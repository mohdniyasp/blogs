Block quote -> sentence or paragraph that's been specially formatted to draw attention to the reader
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I read this interesting quote the other day:

>"Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"

quote spans multiple paragraphs => 
>Once upon a time and a very good time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo...
>
>His father told him that story: his father looked at him through a glass: he had a hairy face.
>
He was baby tuckoo. The moocow came down the road where Betty Byrne lived: she sold lemon platt.

lists
-----
unordered list
* Milk
* Eggs
* Salmon
* Butter

ordered list
1. Cut the cheese
2. Slice the tomatoes
3. Rub the tomatoes in flour

nested list
-----------
* Tintin
 * A reporter
 * Has poofy orange hair
 * Friends with the world's most awesome dog
* Haddock
 * A sea captain
 * Has a fantastic beard
 * Loves whiskey
   * Possibly also scotch?

Suppose you want to create a bullet list that requires some additional context (but not another list). For example, it might look like this:

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl.

 Now, you're going to want to crack the eggs in such a way that you don't make a mess.

 If you _do_ make a mess, use a towel to clean it up!

2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl.

 Basically, take the same guidance as above: don't be messy, but if you are, clean it up!

3. Rub the salmon vigorously with butter.

   By "vigorous," we mean a strictly vertical motion. Julia Child once quipped:
   > Up and down and all around, that's how butter on salmon goes.
4. Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl.

   Here are some techniques on salmon-dropping:

   * Make sure no trout or children are present
   * Use both hands
   * Always have a towel nearby in case of messes

paragraph -> add two spaces at end of each line (*) represents one space

Very well then I contradict myself,路路
